		<h3>Our Mission</h3>

	<div class="mission-section">
		<p>We are rock climbers before shoe repair businessmen. Our mission is to give back to the community and help keep fellow climbers on the rock. Climbing shoes are expensive. Buying a new pair of shoes every time the sole wears out is unreasonable. Let us get your favorite, perfectly fitting shoe back on your feet and feeling brand new.</p>
